# JStorage

JStorage is an intermediary storage file reader, processor and writer written in Java. 

JStorage is able to read from a variety of file types (json, yaml, xml) into a Java class where attributes can easily be accessed, edited and rewrote into different or the same formats.

JStorage aims to dump data in a readable file format known as a .jstor file.
It aims to be easy to read and understand, minorly scriptable and suitable to hand type.

Note: JStorage is currently in extremely early alpha and is still being updated.
